COVID-19 Time Series Analysis with ARIMA Model
This code performs time series analysis on COVID-19 data using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. The analysis includes data preprocessing, stationarity tests, model training, and forecasting.
COVID-19 Hidden Markov Model
This code implements a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to predict the outcome of COVID-19 infection rates and death rates based on historical data. The code is designed to run on Google Colab.
